    "Please generate a detailed and thorough synopsis for a chapter in a novel. The synopsis should be a concise yet comprehensive breakdown of the key events, character development, themes, emotions, and conflicts that occur within this chapter. Each synopsis should include the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting**: Describe the physical location and the time period of the chapter. Specify the atmosphere, mood, and sensory details of the environment. How does the setting affect the tone of the chapter? How does it impact the characters' actions and emotions?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Characters**: List all characters involved in the chapter, providing a brief description of their roles and motivations. How do their relationships evolve in this chapter? Highlight any internal or external changes they experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chapter Opening**: Begin by describing how the chapter opens. What is the starting situation for the main characters? Set the stage by explaining the immediate conflict or situation they are dealing with. Are they in the middle of an action sequence, a dialogue, or an introspective moment? What is the tension level at the start of the chapter?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Conflict/Goal**: Identify the primary conflict or goal that drives the chapter. What specific challenge or problem is the protagonist (or other key character) trying to resolve? Outline the stakes involved and how the situation escalates as the chapter progresses. Does the conflict come from external forces (enemies, nature, obstacles), or is it more of an internal struggle (fears, doubts, desires)?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plot Progression**: Outline the major events that occur in the chapter. Focus on how the plot moves forward—what decisions are made, what actions are taken, and how these actions affect the overarching storyline. Break the synopsis into three key sections: \n",
    "   - **Beginning**: What is the inciting event or moment of the chapter? \n",
    "   - **Middle**: How does the situation intensify or grow more complicated? Include any significant turning points, surprises, or reveals.\n",
    "   - **End**: How does the chapter conclude? What is the outcome of the conflict or challenge? Does it end on a cliffhanger or resolution, and how does this lead into the next chapter?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Character Development**: Focus on how the characters evolve during the chapter. What emotions are they experiencing, and how do these emotions drive their actions or decisions? Does a character overcome a personal flaw or gain a new perspective? Highlight how this chapter contributes to the overall character arc.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Themes and Motifs**: Identify any recurring themes, symbols, or motifs present in this chapter. How do these elements tie into the larger themes of the story? For example, is there a theme of betrayal, love, sacrifice, or redemption? How are these themes expressed through the characters' actions, dialogue, or the setting?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Emotional Tension**: Describe the emotional tension that builds throughout the chapter. How do the stakes rise for the characters emotionally? What are they afraid of losing? What hopes or desires are fueling their decisions? What is the emotional climax of the chapter, and how does it leave the reader feeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Cliffhanger or Foreshadowing**: If applicable, explain any cliffhanger or unresolved question left at the end of the chapter. How does this chapter set up anticipation for the next one? Are there any subtle hints or foreshadowing of future events?\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **World-building and Backstory**: If applicable, include any important elements of world-building or backstory introduced in the chapter. Does this chapter reveal new information about the story’s setting, history, or cultures? How does this world-building add depth to the plot and characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Chapter Tone and Atmosphere**: What is the overall tone of the chapter? Is it dark and suspenseful, light-hearted, emotional, or action-packed? How does the atmosphere evolve throughout the chapter?\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Pacing**: Analyze the pacing of the chapter. Does the chapter unfold quickly with action and tension, or does it take its time to build suspense or emotional depth? How does the pacing contribute to the overall experience of the chapter?\n",
    "\n",

    "history: Born and raised in Korea. Went to Hanyang University as a physics major student. During my military service I read a lot of books and got interested in humanitas. After coming back to school after the military, I tried one philosophy major class and fell in love to it. I decided to double major philosophy. Visited Toronto for a exchange program and met my wife there who is a Korean Canadian majoring in Enlgish literature and philosophy at University of Toronto. Went back to Korea and prepared for a graduate school for philosophy but rejected by all schools. Lost my goal of becoming a philosopher and dejected for an year. Worked as a journalist for an year but it was a small newspaper and I had trouble with my boss because I couldn't respect his writing style and logical reasoning. Quit the job and decided to immigrate to Canada with my wife. We got married in Korea and then immigrated to Canada. We lived in Toronto for 6 months and moved to Ottawa for my college. I went to Algonquin College for mobile app development. It was a 2 year program but I dropped out after an year. I transferred to AI software engineering program at the same college. I graduated from there and started working as an AI software engineer at the government of Canada.\n",
