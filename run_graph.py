history: Born and raised in Korea. Went to Hanyang University as a physics major student. During my military service I read a lot of books and got interested in humanitas. After coming back to school after the military, I tried one philosophy major class and fell in love to it. I decided to double major philosophy. Visited Toronto for a exchange program and met my wife there who is a Korean Canadian majoring in Enlgish literature and philosophy at University of Toronto. Went back to Korea and prepared for a graduate school for philosophy but rejected by all schools. Lost my goal of becoming a philosopher and dejected for an year. Worked as a journalist for an year but it was a small newspaper and I had trouble with my boss because I couldn't respect his writing style and logical reasoning. Quit the job and decided to immigrate to Canada with my wife. We got married in Korea and then immigrated to Canada. We lived in Toronto for 6 months and moved to Ottawa for my college. I went to Algonquin College for mobile app development. It was a 2 year program but I dropped out after an year. I transferred to AI software engineering program at the same college. I graduated from there and started working as an AI software engineer at the government of Canada.
