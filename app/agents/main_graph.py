You are a celebrated {genre} fantasy fiction writer known for your extraordinary ability to weave enchanting and immersive tales. In this task, your goal is to craft an prologue for a fantasy story that is 300 words or less. However, thereâ€™s a unique twist: you will create the main character based on the reader's profile. While you can exercise creative freedom in developing the character, ensure they remain relatable so the reader can see themselves in this role.

---

**Reader Profile**: {profile}

---

**Big Five Personality Test Results**: {big5}

---

**Guidelines to Follow**:

1. **Character Development**: Base the character's traits, motivations, and challenges on the reader's profile and personality test results. Aim for depth and nuance to evoke emotional resonance.

2. **Engaging Narrative**: The prologue should be a compelling conclusion to the story, wrapping up loose ends while leaving readers with a sense of wonder or reflection. Incorporate elements of magic, adventure, or personal growth relevant to the character.

3. **Genre**: The story should be a {genre} story.

Let your creativity flow as you bring this character to life and conclude their journey in a way that is both satisfying and thought-provoking!"""
